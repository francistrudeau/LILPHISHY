# LIL PHISY extension for `Chrom(?:e|ium)`

## Chrome Plugin that parses the DOM, turns it into json and dumps it into ES

Plugin will look for `es_url` and `passwd` files in the same directory as the plugin.  You'll have to create them for your environment.


This is an `unpacked` extension loaded through developer mode in `Chrom(?:e|ium)`.

In Chromium:

`menu` &rarr; `more tools` &rarr; `extensions`

Upper right turn on `Developer mode`.

Click `Load unpacked` and find the directory you cloned.

Other browsers might be different, you'll have to figure it out.
